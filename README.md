# Crossfund
A decentralised crowdfunding app.


## Problem Statement?
The problem in the current crowdfunding process is verifying if the collected funds are actually being used for the purpose mentioned.To solve this, we have introduced a decentralised method for crowdfunding. We have tried to implement a crosschain way for users to donate as using the Router protocol.
The representative of the oragnization sets a few goals like why they need the money, the deadline for the fund-raiser, minimum contribution required to be part of crowdfunding. Here, the crowd (users) instead of donating directly to the hands of the manager the fund is given to a smart contract created by the company. Now, to pull the funds from the smart contract the voting should happen and if 50% (or any set amount) of the crowd agrees then only the funds can be withdrawn else it won't be.
If incase the target(money required) is not met by the deadline the crowd can withdraw their money from the smart contract.

Currently deployed on Polygon.
